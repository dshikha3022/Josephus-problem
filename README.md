A children's game  “hot potato,” a group of children sit in a circle passing an object, called the “potato,” around the circle . There are 'n' children sitting in a circle numbered from 1 to n. Also given an integer k. First, count the k-th number starting from the first one and delete the (k+1)th child , i.e., after every kth passes you have to eliminate one child. Then k numbers are counted starting from the next one and the (k+1)th one is removed again, and so on. The process stops when one child remains. The task is to find the number of last child.
